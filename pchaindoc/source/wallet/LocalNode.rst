Local Node Mode
===============

To use the local node mode of pchain's wallet, you should prepare a pchain's rpc url which allows you to access. If you already running pchain on server, run pchain with flag `--rpcaddr=0.0.0.0`.

Important:
Pchain RPC's defalut port is 6969, remember open your port 6969 **only** to your local ip and don't keep your account unlock for long time!!! 

First, set the RPC url in wallet:

After this, pchain's wallet will read the chain state to wallet.
