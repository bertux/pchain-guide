How to apply for a Validator Candidate
======================================

Note : you can do this only on wallet's local node mode, please go to this `guide <https://pchaindoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wallet/LocalNode.html>`_ to set up the RPC URL.

| You can apply for a candidate via PIwallet under the local mode. If you are a developer, you can also `call for RPC <https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain/wiki/How-to-Become-a-Candidate>`_ to apply.

First, unlock your account. (Please do not keep your account unlock for long time, we recommand set the 'unlockDuration' to 300. If you set it to 0, your account will unlock forever unless you lock it manually)
