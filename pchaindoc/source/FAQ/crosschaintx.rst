If you click “check” and it returns “Failed Transaction”, it means you need to resend PI to recover this transaction. Pls click “Resend” directly.

If it returns with one transaction hash, it means resend successfully. You can check the balance within 2 minutes.
If it returns “Error” like the picture below, pls click “Detail” of the first transaction record and make a copy of the transaction hash. Then send this Tx hash & your address to PCHAIN Team (op@pchain.org). PCHAIN team will help you make this transaction successful in 1~2 business day(s).
