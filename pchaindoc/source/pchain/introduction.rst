PCHAIN Introduction
===================

    Welcome to `pchain <https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain>`_.

Introduction
-------------------

| PCHAIN, the Super-Ethereum, is the largest scale native EVM multichain system in the world, which can support 256 child chains across continents with 180K TPS and confirm transaction in seconds. PCHAIN is the first public chain investment in Asia Pacific by Google incubator Plug & Play.  It’s designed to make large scale blockchain applications possible. At present, PCHAIN has achieved strategic cooperation with many Fortune 500 companies.

| PCHAIN was founded by renowned senior experts including the first inventor of international blockchain patent in Chian,  a National “Thousand People Plan”professor, a Singapore Presidential Awards winner, a former IBM Greater China Blockchain Technical Leader. In total, the team has published 100 IEEE ACM papers and international patents. PCHAIN was granted 6 patents and the book named Ethereum Technology Details and Practices, which was openly recommended by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum.

| PCHAIN has received strategic investment from more than 40 top-level global funds such as FBG, Plug&Play, Node Capital, LD Capital, JRR, Block VC and LinkVC,etc. PCHAIN was ranked Top 2 on the World Blockchain Top List by multiple overseas blockchain rating institutions. PCHAIN also received the Silicon Valley’s“Most Promising Blockchain Foundation Platform 2018”award and was hailed as the“Best Blockchain Platform in 2018”by Bitcoinist. PCHAIN has board collaboration with over 30 blockchain partners such as North America Blockchain Association, IEEE, CFLP, etc.

| The key innovative technologies include:

| 1. The 1st native EVM multichain enables the interoperability of child chain and main chain. It can support 256 child chains and more without pressure on main chain in testnet 1.0 with 1064 nodes globally. The peak TPS is 126K TPS and it can be scale linearly as the number of child chains increases.

| 2. The patented PDBFT algorithm greatly reduced communication cost from N^2 to N comparing with traditional BFT algorithm. It can effectively reduce the centralization problem as the number of nodes is limited.

| 3. A new Oracle mechanism based on the knowledge graph makes it easier to encapsulate smart contracts. W3C compliant smart data effectively addresses the issue of non-intelligence in smart contracts

| 4. Safe Delegation and Blind Bidding effectively avoid token transaction between delegators and candidates and avoid the risk of evil by candidates. Also, Blind Bidding mechanism enables the validator election more fair and secure in epoch switch.

| 5. Cross chain capability. The smart contracts of PCHAIN can be easily invoked with other nonnative tokens (BCH, ERC20) by using the provided toolkit.
