PCHAIN POS mining and incentive mechanisms

- POS mining:

	315 million PCHAIN tokens are reserved for PoS mining, distributed over 24 years:

	80% will be allocated to PCHAIN main chain. The remaining 20% will be distributed on PCHAIN official child chains. The first 6 months will be dedicated to the official child chain 1 while the further distribution on the official child chains will be ultimately determined and announced by the PCHAIN Foundation.

- Validators incentive mechanisms:

	• The PoS mining reward of each block belongs to its proposal (the Validator who generates the block), your chance to be a proposal equals the weight of your staked tokens. Important: you need to be online for a maximum of blocks otherwise your chances will decline.

	• The PoS mining reward of each block is locked until the Epoch reaches 100% height. (An Epoch is ~30 days on mainnet, based on block generations between two election rounds)

	• After each Epoch reaches 100% height, the PCHAIN reward system calculates the actual PoS mining reward of the Validators. Distribution is made in 12 Epochs.

When you are a Validator candidate and become Validator successfully, your PoS mining reward is automatically shared with all your delegators based on the percentage of delegation.
